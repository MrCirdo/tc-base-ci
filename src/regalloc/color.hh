    Removing a node from the graph involves decrementing the degree

    added to the \a simplify_work_list_.  When the degree of a neighbor
    transitions from K to K - 1, moves associated with \e its neighbors
    may be enabled.

    The algorithm as specified by Appel may have a small period during
    which the invariants are not preserved.  When one successfully
    coalesce two different nodes a and b, they are combined (see combine).
    As part of this merge, nodes adjacent to b become adjacent to a:
    there is a call to \a add_edge, which increases the degree.  But
    this degree ought is decrement immediatly afterwards.  Now, it is
    possible under some conditions that the "add_edge" had increased
    the degree of a node from k - 1 to k<em>without moving the node
    from work list</em>.  And then decrement_degree will see that the degree
    was k, and therefore that the status of the node is to be changed.
    The problem is that its status was not updated by add_edge, so a
    strict invariant check will see that we try to remove a node from
    spill_work_list_, where it is not.

    That's not a problem: just don't be too strict on the invariant
    check here.  */
